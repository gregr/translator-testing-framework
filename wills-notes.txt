Will's notes on running the `behave` tests for mediKanren, since much of the README from the forked repo isn't applicable to us.  I've paraphrased some of Greg's comments as well.

----------------------------------


Clone this repository,

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:gregr/translator-testing-framework.git
```

After cloning the repo, set up a virtual environment using Python 3's `venv` module

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

The command creates a virtual environment `venv`, which may be activated by typing:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

To exit the environment, type:

```
deactivate
```

To reenter, source the activate command again.


Now install required packages, using a safer way to execute `pip`: 

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

The `--no-cache-dir` flag ensures that the latest git repositories of special dependency projects are imported each 
time this command is run, given the "research and development" nature of this testing repo.

Note that given the rapid cycles of development of the various NCATS projects being covered by Behave tests, it is 
advisable to periodically rerun the pip module installation process to ensure access to the latest synchronized code, 
especially after a `git pull` operation is done.



Run the behave tests from the terminal you just set up using the steps above, with the command:

behave -i features/medikanren-tests.feature --no-capture --no-capture-stderr

Those no-capture flags are optional, but necessary if you want to use print debugging

Note that the `translator-web-server` from within the `mediKanren/biolink` directory must be running in another terminal (without any of the special setup above):

racket translator-web-server.rkt


You can add new tests by adding `Scenarios` to

translator-testing-framework/features/medikanren-tests.feature

The natural language specs are incredibly fragile, so try to get the wording exactly right.  In that last line of the original test, n02 and UMLS:C1823619 are the parameters.
